# Skyrim Auto Modder

### Introduction

Greetings, This resipritory is for the Skyrim Auto Modder that is currently being developed.
This auto modder allows users to easily download a "starter pack" of things to get modding started.

It must be annoying to download SO **MANY** MODS to get **1** mod for Skyrim. This Auto Modder tool fixes this issue by automatically downloading popular requisite mods.
### What to expect

This checklist will show what is to be expected, planned, and already completed.
Key: (x) = Completed, (o) = planned
- Auto detect between AE and SE versions. _(Currently only available for SE)_
- Auto-Downloads LOOT(x), SKSE(x), Unofficial Skyrim Patch(o), SKSE Library (o).
- Auto unpacks and places mods and loaders in their respective folders. (o)
- Knows if Skyrim is not installed on the C: drive but somwehere else. (o)

### Contributions
Contributions are welcome and a **MAJOR** help (because i'm a bit dumb when it comes to C#)

### How to Install
Currently, it is not recommended to download it (yet) because it's pretty basic and doesn't do much.
but for releases there will be a zip file containing some files it needs to run and the .exe file to easily use.
