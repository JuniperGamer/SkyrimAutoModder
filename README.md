### Introduction
Welcome to the Skyrim Auto Modder repository! This tool aims to streamline the initial setup process for modding The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. It can be quite a hassle to manually download and set up all the prerequisite mods and tools needed for a specific Skyrim mod. The Skyrim Auto Modder takes care of these preliminary steps automatically, saving you time and effort.

### What to Expect
Below is the checklist showing our current progress and future plans. Key: (x) = Completed, (o) = Planned

- Auto detect between Anniversary Edition (AE) and Special Edition (SE) versions of Skyrim. (Currently only available for AE)
- Auto download LOOT(x), SKSE(x), Unofficial Skyrim Patch(o), and SKSE Library (o).
- Auto unpack and place mods and loaders in their respective folders. (o, probabaly won't happen)
- Detect if Skyrim is not installed on the C: drive but somewhere else. (o)
### Contributions
We welcome and appreciate contributions to the Skyrim Auto Modder project! While we're mainly using C# for development, don't worry if you're not an expert â€“ we value all input and assistance.

### How to Install
At the moment, we don't recommend downloading Skyrim Auto Modder as it's still in the early stages of development and may not offer full functionality. However, once it's ready for release, you'll find a zip file in the "Releases" section containing the necessary runtime files and an executable (.exe) for easy use.

Please note that you'll need the .NET SDK installed to run the program.
